      <h2>Starting Paladin in Violent Winds</h2>
      <p><small>Wednesday July 02, 2025</small></p>
      <p>Here is an outline of the story from the <a href="https://foxswuxia.wordpress.com/condor-trilogy-heaven-sword-dragon-saber/yttlj-chapter-40/">English translation</a> of Jinyong’s novel Yitian Tulong Ji (The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Sabre):</p>

</ul>

<p>Taking the scene <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Zhou Zhiruo threatens Zhang Wuji with a sword, claiming Yin Li's ghost is haunting her</code> as an opening, the narrations can look like this:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The flickering torchlight danced across Zhou Zhiruo's face, casting long,
distorted shadows that writhed like vengeful spirits. Her grip on the sword trembled,
not entirely from fear, but from a chilling conviction that clung to her like grave dust.
Her eyes, usually serene, were wide and haunted, fixed on Zhang Wuji with a desperate terror.

"It's her!" she gasped, her voice a ragged whisper that seemed to carry the icy breath of the grave.
"Yin Li... she's here. I saw her... her face... all twisted... blaming me!"

The air in the small chamber felt heavy, thick with an unseen presence.
A low moan seemed to echo from the shadows, though Zhang Wuji heard nothing
but Zhou Zhiruo's frantic breaths. The accusation hung between them, sharp and deadly
as the blade she wielded, painting a gruesome tableau of guilt and spectral vengeance.
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Cut off to Yin Li scene</strong>*</p>

<h2 id="transition-to-dialogue">Transition to Dialogue</h2>

<p>Yin Li looked at him with a tender expression for a long, long time.
Her eyes changed irregularly. Finally, she shook her head and said,
“Aniu Gege, you don’t understand. In the western region desert, you and I
have gone through live and death situation together. On that small
island, you were extremely good to me. You are a good man. But I have
already told you, I have given my heart to that Zhang Wuji for a long
time. I am going to find him. Tell me, do you think if I find him, he
would still beat me, scold me or bite me?”</p>

<p>Without waiting for Zhang Wuji to answer, she turned around and slowly walked away.</p>

<p>Suddenly Zhang Wuji understood. Turned out the one she truly loved
was the Zhang Wuji who lived in her memory, the Zhang Wuji she met in
the Butterfly Valley, the one who beat her and bite her, the obstinate
Zhang Wuji who refused to follow her; not the real Zhang Wuji, the grown
up Zhang Wuji who was extremely tolerant and always treated people with
kindness. One third part of his heart was wounded, one third of it was
reluctant to let her go, yet the other third part was relieved. He
followed her with his gaze until her shadow disappeared into the
darkness. He knew that for the rest of her life, Yin Li would always
remember the very strong teenage boy of the Butterfly Valley, and that
she would always want to find him. He realized that she would never find
the one she was looking for, but then again, he could say that she had
already found him, because that boy had always lived in her heart. Isn’t
it true that oftentimes, the real person, the actual matter, is not as
good as the one inside one’s memory?</p>

<p>Zhou Zhiruo sighed and said, “It’s all my fault. I harmed her so bad that she turns crazy.”</p>

<p>Yet Zhang Wuji thought, “She might be a little confused, and that was
because of me. But compared to a clear-minded person, she is not
necessarily less happy.”</p>

<p>Zhao Min, however, had another matter in her mind. Yin Li had gone,
but what about Zhou Zhiruo? Yin Li had not died, Xie Xun had been found,
safe and well, the martial art manual concealed inside the Yitian
Sword, as well as the military strategy manual inside the Tulong Saber,
along with the Saber itself, had been recovered and returned to Zhang
Wuji. In short, it appeared that Zhou Zhiruo’s offenses and mistakes had
not turned to the worst. While it was true that Song Qingshu had killed
Mo Shenggu because of her, but it was Song Qingshu’s own crime; Zhou
Zhiruo actually did not have any foreknowledge of the matter, also, she
certainly did not instigate the incident. Zhang Wuji had had an
engagement with her before, and he was not the kind of man who would
abandon trust and uprightness.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhiruo stood up. “Let’s go!” she said.</p>

<p>“Where?” Zhao Min asked.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhiruo replied, “When I was at the Shaolin Temple just now, I
saw <strong>Zhang Zhong</strong> came in a hurry to look for him,” she gestured
toward Zhang Wuji. “Apparently, there is some important matter within
the Ming Cult.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Notice that I’ve changed the original cast of Peng Yingyu to Zhang Zhong
in the above scene. This is a preparation for various changes in some
other places.</p>

<h2 id="historical-context-yuan-dynasty-circa-1355">Historical Context (Yuan Dynasty, circa 1355)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Political Instability:</strong> The Yuan Dynasty, established by the Mongol rulers, 
was facing increasing internal strife and external pressure. Han Chinese resentment was high, 
leading to widespread rebellions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Famine and Oppression:</strong> Natural disasters and heavy taxation by the Yuan government
exacerbated the suffering of the populace, fueling the rebellions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rise of Rebel Groups:</strong> Various factions were emerging, vying for power
and aiming to overthrow the Yuan. <strong>The Red Turban Rebellion</strong>, associated with the White Lotus Society,
was a major force.The Ming Cult’s</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Historical Role: The Ming Cult (Manichaeism) had connections to some of these rebellions,
often serving as a unifying force for the Han Chinese seeking to restore their own rule.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Character Modifications</strong> (Considering the Historical Context):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Zhang Wuji and the Ming Cult: His leadership of the Ming Cult would be even more
significant in this historical context. He would be leading a group deeply involved in the anti-Yuan uprisings,
making his decisions have significant political and military ramifications. His tolerance and kindness might be
tested by the harsh realities of rebellion and warfare.</li>
  <li>Zhao Min: As a Mongol princess, her position becomes even more complex and potentially dangerous.
Her relationship with Zhang Wuji would be seen as a betrayal by her own people. Her intelligence and strategic mind
could be crucial in navigating the political landscape, perhaps even influencing the course of the rebellions.</li>
  <li>Zhou Zhiruo and the Emei Sect: We might need to consider the Emei Sect’s stance during this period.
Would they align themselves with the Han Chinese resistance, remain neutral, or even be manipulated by Yuan forces?
Zhou Zhiruo’s personal ambitions and the secrets of the Emei could be intertwined with the larger political conflicts.</li>
  <li>Yin Li (蛛儿): Her personal quest for Zhang Wuji would unfold against this backdrop of war and rebellion.
Her “craziness” and fixation on the past Zhang Wuji might be a form of escapism from the harsh realities of the time.
Her fate could be tied to the broader conflicts.</li>
  <li>Other Characters: We might need to consider how characters like Xie Xun, the various martial arts sects (Wudang, Shaolin, etc.),
and even minor characters fit into this historical tapestry. Some might be actively involved in the rebellion,
while others might try to remain aloof.</li>
</ul>

<p>Impact on the Opening Scene:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The initial confrontation with Zhou Zhiruo and Yin Li’s subsequent departure would occur within this politically
charged environment. The urgency and stakes would be higher due to the ongoing rebellions. The Ming Cult’s
“important matter” that Monk Peng Yingyu needs to inform Zhang Wuji about could very well be related to the
unfolding historical events.Now, with this historical context in mind.</li>
  <li>Someone might suddenly appear as a surprise.</li>
</ul>
